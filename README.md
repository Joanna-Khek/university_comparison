# Rshiny Singapore University Comparison App
## About
Hi there. My name is Joanna Khek Cuina and this is my submission for Rshiny Competition 2020. With the recent release of A Level results, i was motivated to build a informative dashboard to help my fellow Singaporeans with their university course choice. There are many factors to consider when choosing a university and such information are often scattered around the different websites. Hence, I thought it would be a good idea to consolidate all useful information into one dashboard.

In this web application, i have only compared National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University as there are more readily available data from them given their relatively longer history in Singapore. 

## Application



## Features
The following information are found in the dashboard:
1. Eligible Courses - Find out what courses are you eligible for from the different universities
2. Ranking - Find out the world and asia ranking of the different universities
3. Graduates - Find out the number of intakes and graduates from the different universities
4. Employment - Find out the overall employment rate and mean income of the different courses from the different universities
