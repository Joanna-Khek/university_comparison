# Rshiny Singapore University Comparison App
## About
Hi there. My name is Joanna Khek Cuina and this is my submission for Rshiny Competition 2020. With the recent release of A Level results, i was motivated to build a informative dashboard to help my fellow Singaporeans with their university course choice. There are many factors to consider when choosing a university and such information are often scattered around the different websites. Hence, I thought it would be a good idea to consolidate all useful information into one dashboard.

In this web application, i have only compared National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University as there are more readily available data from them given their relatively longer history in Singapore. 

Some of the main packages used for building this web application are argonDash, highcharter, reactable and shinywidgets.
It has truly been an enjoyable experience building this dashboard and i've learnt a lot during the process
